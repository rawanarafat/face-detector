# face-detector
## My face detector program is designed to detect faces in an image and highlight them with a green box. The program uses advanced algorithms to detect the presence of a face in the image and once it finds one, it draws a green box around the face to isolate it from the rest of the image. The green box serves as a visual representation of the face detection process and helps to clearly distinguish the face from the background. This feature makes it easier for users to select the face for further processing or analysis. Overall, the face detector program offers a quick and efficient way to detect and isolate faces in an image.
